    "Pandas is a huge module with loads of different features; some of which we'll use in this course and many of which we won't. The function which we'll use most of all is <code>DataFrame()</code>. A Pandas DataFrame stores tabular data, like an Excel spreadsheet, however in Pandas you can't access and edit the cells directly - you instead need to manipulate the data programmatically.\n",

    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, <code>plotly.plotly</code> makes the chart and pushes it to your plotly account in the cloud. We'll use this when we're happy with the chart we've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>pandas</code> is a great library for data analysis and manipulation. It's very powerful and very complex; a full tutorial on how to use it is far beyond the scope of this course, but there are a few functions that we'll use repeatedly, one of these being a pandas DataFrame."
